        KSD-type signal boxes are designed for signalling status
        of the facility. They are mounted in matrix frames; caps
        of the signal boxes are flushed with the surface of the front
        panels of STM boards and control desks. Sets of signal
        boxes enclosed in aluminium frames can also be fixed
        in metal, wood-like or other plates (e.g. cabinets, desktops
        and top segments).<br/>
        <h2>TECHNICAL DATA</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Control voltage: 18-24 V DC</li>
            <li>Power consumption: ca. 80 mA</li>
            <li>Colour of illumination: red, green, yellow</li>
            <li>Dimensions: 50.3 x 25.15 mm</li>
            <li>Outlets: rack and panel connector,
        terminal strip or other types,
        based on individual
        arrangements</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>DESIGN</h2>
        Each box incorporates three basic elements: a main body, a LED plate and a cap (non-transparent white). The surface of the cap has an inscription, sign or symbol plotted by screen printing or engraved. Another possibility is the use of transparent caps with inscriptions made on mat film or tracing paper placed underneath. Signal boxes are made as single units or in multiple sets in any configuration.
