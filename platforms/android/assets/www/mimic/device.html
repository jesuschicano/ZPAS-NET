        ZPAS-NET mimic boards offer a possibility of installing
        meters, indicators, displays, switches, controllers, etc.,
        however in consideration of the fact that customers
        use a wide variety of different devices, their installation
        in the mimic boards is always tailored to individual needs
        and requirements.<br/>
        Since the majority of devices is designed for assembly
        on thin front panels made of sheet metal, some devices must be provided with special clamping rings or support brackets (particularly if the weight of a given device may cause front panel deformation).<br/>

        If the dimensions of a device do not correspond to
        a multiple of the boardâ€™s module, we offer a range
        of adaptor elements which allow for construction
        of a special frame helping to adjust the device to the
        module. Controllers and switches are usually mounted
        by means of adaptor plates with front sections covered
        with the same surface patterns as the front sections
        of the boards. Details concerning installation methods
        are individually agreed with the customer.
