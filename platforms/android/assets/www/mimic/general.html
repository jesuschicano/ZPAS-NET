        Mimic panels allow to graphically represent technology
processes, diagrams of power networks, water supply
and distribution network, gas grids, plans and other
individually arranged solutions. With the application
of modern, complex and automated technologies, mimic
boards serve as a visualisation tool effectively supporting
control and management processes. Thanks to the use of
modules incorporating light components, it is possible to
instantly visualise expanding and changing processes and to
reflect the operating condition of devices by means of LED
signalling with an option of control from front panel devices.
