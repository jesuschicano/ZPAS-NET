        <h2>National Power Dispatch Centre (KDM)</h2>
        In February 2009, ZPAS-NET completed the project
        consisting of the provision of equipment to dispatching
        centres at the main seat of PSE-OPERATOR in Konstancin-
        Jeziorna. The scope of works included design, architecture,
        interior layout and equipment, as well as technical
        infrastructure (structural wiring, process power supply,
        voice communication systems, IT network systems
        and visualisation systems). Works were carried out at three
        dispatching centres:
        <ul>
            <li>KDM – National Power Dispatch Centre,</li>
            <li>CNOS – Control Centre for Network Facilities,</li>
            <li>CNOT – Control Centre for ITC Facilities</li>
        </ul>

        Architectural solutions employed at KDM are also worth
        noting. The colour scheme adopted for the interiors,
        incorporating a dark blue dispatching panel (the
        dominating feature), uses sea green wall panels and
        malachite green Corian finishing elements of window sills
        and dispatching desks, to create a distinctive ambience
        of the facility, referring to the interiors of the Nautilus,
        a Captain Nemo’s ship.<br/>
        Technical solutions adopted for audio and video signal
        transmission, keyboard, mouse and USB are based
        on KVM extenders. Dispatching system workstations
        are accommodated in technology cabinets located in
        server rooms. Dispatching stations and terminals are
        interconnected using multi-mode optical fibers.
        The solution helped achieve extra free space in dispatch
        desks and increase the comfort of work by reducing noise
        and temperature levels.
