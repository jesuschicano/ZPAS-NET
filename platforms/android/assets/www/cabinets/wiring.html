        <h2>FS wiring cabinets</h2>
        Wiring cabinets are made based on of SZD enclosures
        and intended for outdoor use. Electric
        instrumentation installed inside the cabinets is used for
        supplying power to and controlling drives of hV and MV
        power station switches as well as for transmitting data from
        measuring circuits.
        As a standard, the plinth of the cabinet is equipped with a
        firescreen compartment. In addition, it is possible to deliver
        the cabinet in an option with a special concrete foundation.
        The cabinet has a basic wiring system designed for:
        <ul>
            <li>supplying power to the cabinet’s circuits and transferring
        it to other cabinets;</li>
            <li>maintaining preset climatic conditions inside the cabinet</li>
        to ensure correct operation of electric devices;
            <li>providing a lighting system;</li>
            <li>supplying power to one- and three-phase maintenance
        sockets;</li>
            <li>installing electric gear inside the cabinet, as per
        customer’s request and in accordance with specifications
        prepared for a specific facility.</li>
        </ul>
        The basic configuration of the wiring cabinet is made in
        conformance with assumptions typically adopted for wiring
        cabinets designed for hV and MV power stations and is
        available with or without sectionalisation of circumferential
        circuits.<br/>
        The basic electric circuits of the cabinet are protected by
        means of RCCbs with overcurrent protection. The cabinet’s
        heating is provided using two Cirrus 60 heaters, with a
        power output of 400 W each, controlled by means of a kTO
        1140 thermostat with a control range of 0-60 °C. heating is
        controlled automatically using the thermostat or manually,
        by means of a special switch located in the control panel.
        40 W light fixtures, one on each side of the cabinet, are
        powered by door limit switches or manually, by means of a
        switch located in the control panel. The basic wiring system
        is designed for the operation in the TN-C-S power system.
        The wiring cabinet meets the requirements listed in the
        EN 60439-1 standard.
