        <h2>AC auxiliaries switchgears 400/230 V FX,FA</h2>
        FX, FA auxiliaries switchgears offered by ZPAS are indoorstructures, designed for supplying auxiliary demand of MV and LV switchrooms.<br/>
        FX and FA switchgears are based on SZE2 enclosures. They consist of three or more cabinets with dimensions 2000 x 600-1200 x 600-800 mm.<br/>
        Depending on customer requirements or equipment
        provided by the technical design, cabinet construction can be customized to individual needs â€“ both in terms of dimensions and equipment.<br/>
        <b>A typical configuration of Fx and FA switchgears:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>solid or glazed front door,</li>
            <li>access to equipment on one side or both sides,</li>
            <li>terminal strips, busbar trunkings are mounted inside the cabinet on the mounting plate or the system of mounting profiles,</li>
            <li>descriptions made as requested and according to standard of the facility which the switchgears aredesigned for, - plinth with a height of 100 or 200 mm, solid or perforated.</li>
        </ul>
        Auxiliaries switchgear 400/230 V AC is supplied from two or
        more sources. Circuit-breakers or contactors are fitted in the
        main tracks in accordance with the project requirements.
        The basic element of the system is the SZR automation
        system tailored to customer requirements. For protecting
        outgoing feeds, fused load break switches, e.g. Nh, TYTAN
        II, circuit breakers or thermal fuses are used. Each outgoing
        track is led to the terminal block. Switchgears are equipped
        with measurement of current and voltage of each incoming
        feed. Meters can be located on switchgear door or inside
        the cabinet on masking panels. Switchgears are equipped
        with signalling and emergency circuits incorporated into the
        station's central signalling system.
