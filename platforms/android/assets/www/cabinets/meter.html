        <h2>FQ meter cabinets</h2>
        Meter cabinets are made on the basis of SZE2 enclosures.
        Depending on a project, their dimensions are
        2000 x 600-800 x 600-800 mm. The typical configuration
        is the mounting plate. There is also a solution with a split
        mounting plate. Its upper part is then rotatable, and
        the lower part is fixed. The upper one is designed for
        installation of electricity meters, whereas the lower one
        for mounting measurement strips. There are also solutions
        with a swing frame. Electricity meters are then mounted on
        the frame, and the measurement strips on the mounting
        plate or the system of mounting profiles. Access may be
        one-sided or two-sided. Glazed door.
        Cabinet configuration is tailored to the station design
        and can always be adapted to the customer's requirements
        â€“ both in terms of dimensions and equipment.
