        <h2>Telecomunication cabinets</h2>
        FT and SUT telecommunication cabinets are made based
        on of SZE2 and SZb enclosures. Their dimensions are
        2000 x 600 x 600-800 mm. The typical configuration
        includes front glazed door, a set of 19" mounting profiles
        in front and rear of the cabinet, equipment protected
        by IP 30 masking panels. Access is one-sided. Usually
        it houses equipment for collecting information on the
        state of the station, and transferring the information to
        the master system. Cabinet configuration is tailored to
        the station design and can always be adapted to the
        customer's requirements â€“ both in terms of dimensions
        and equipment.
