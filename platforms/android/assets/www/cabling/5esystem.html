        <h3>PowerLink 5e system, 5e category, UtP</h3>
       PowerLink 5e system, 5e category, UTP - this is a cable system compatible with trade standards deﬁning all technical
        parameters for 5e category, that is EIA/TIA 568B.2, ISO11801, EN 50173.<br/>
        The basis for the system is a universal IDC (insulation displacement contact) connection compatible with 110 and LSA
        connections. These connections are placed in distribution panels and telecommunication outlets.<br/>
        Unshielded 5e category, UTP cable is of special construction providing increased resistance against mechanical damages.
        Accessible in PVC and LSOH coatings, telecommunication outlets are realized through universal modules. These are keystone
        RJ45 UTP, 5e category transmission modules placed in front plates 22.5 x 45 mm or 25 x 50 mm with anti-dust shutter.
        The offer includes also sockets in “Polish” standard of ﬁxing. ZPAS-NET also offers systems of frames and wall-mounted boxes
        as well as electrical sockets to be applied in dedicated supplying installations.<br/>
        In smaller wall-mounted installations single and dual superﬁcial sockets may turn out to be necessary. These are RJ45 UTP,
        5e category with RJ connection without anti dust shutter.<br/>
        Distribution panels in 1 U height with 24 RJ45 ports and in 2 U height with 48 RJ45 ports are constructed on the basis of
        specially designed printed circuits providing 5e category at maximal density of connections.
        Patch cords are made of cable of “stranded type” at the section of 26 AWg what causes their ﬂexibility and practically full
        resistance against mechanical damages. Smaller section of patch cords provides greater possibilities of them being placed
        in “ordering panels” in a distribution cabinet.
