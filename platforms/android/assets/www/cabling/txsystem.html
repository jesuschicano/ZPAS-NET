        <h3>PowerLink tX system, 6 category, UtP</h3>
        PowerLink TX system, 6 category, UTP - this is a cable system compatible with EIA/TIA 568B.2 norm, specifying parameters
        for 6 category, dedicated for application in transmission systems compliant with 1000 Base-TX protocol.<br/>
        Unshielded UTP, 6 category cable has a special construction providing increased resistance against mechanical damages
        and improving transmission parameters. It is equipped with special plastic divider separating single pairs. Available in PVC
        and LSOH coatings.<br/>
        Telecommunication sockets are realized on the basis of universal modules. These are keystone RJ45, UTP, 6 category placed
        in front plates 22.5 x 45 mm or 25 x 50 mm with anti-dust shutter. The offer also includes sockets in „Polish“ standard of ﬁxing.
        Distribution panels in 1U height with 16 or 24 RJ45 ports realized on the basis of modular patch panels and RJ45 UTP,
        6 category modules.<br/>
        The characteristic feature of patch cords is application of special type RJ45 plugs ﬁxed on the cable by means of molding
        technology. This solution improves transmission parameters of patch cords and protects cable’s connection through
        modular pin.
