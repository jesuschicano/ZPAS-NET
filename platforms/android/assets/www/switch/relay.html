        <h2>Relay-based ATS systems</h2>
    We offer you slow relay-based ATS systems in network-tonetwork
    version in overt or covert backup configuration, and
    a network-to-generator for overt backup. Our ATS system can
    control both contactors and circuit breakers equipped with
    motor drives, and can be supplied with or without them.<br/>
    Installing the system is possible in two variants:
    <ul>
        <li>on the mounting plate (e.g. in SWN cabinet made by ZPAS or
        in any switchgear that has enough space on the plate),</li>
        <li>on 19" frame using a PS-3U panel made by ZPAS.</li>
    </ul>
    The systems provide for signalling the presence of voltage
    across individual power lines and signalling current power
    line that is supplying takeoffs. Supply is switched from the
    primary power supply to the backup and then returns to the
    primary one, once the set delay time has elapsed. The delay
    is set separately for backup switching and return switching.
    Switching to backup network or power generator supply is
    triggered by voltage loss in the primary network or voltage
    asymmetry in at least one phase of the primary network. For
    the network-to-generator configuration, also UPS is provided
    to power the devices that control the ATS system in the event
    of voltage loss in the primary power supply (in the version
    where the system is integrated with the PS-3U panel, UPS is not
    installed inside the panel).
