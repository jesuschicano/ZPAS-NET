        <h2>Capacitor banks</h2>
        Capacitor banks are used for compensation of the induction
        reactive power consumed in most cases by induction
        motors. The purpose of compensation is to reduce the
        power consumed by the plant, which lowers electricity bills.<br/>
        ZPAS-NET produces two types of capacitor banks for
        automatic compensation:<br/>
        <ul>
            <li>The basic version for network with small harmonic
        interference 15% < Sh/ST < 25%</li>
            <li>Version with protective chokes for network with harmonic
        interference 25% < Sh/ST < 35%</li>
        </ul>
        For the production of banks we use Alpivar capacitors of
        Legrand. The capacitors are made with insulation class II in
        the housing made of self-extinguishing polyurethane resin.<br/>
        Each capacitor bundle is triple-protected by:
        <ul>
            <li>self-extinguishing metallized polypropylene tape,</li>
            <li>electrical fuse,</li>
            <li>overpressure disconnector.</li>
        </ul>
        The maximum allowable voltage is 1.18 Un, and the
        maximum allowable current is 1.5 In. Operating temperature
        -25/+55Â°C. Capacitors have internal discharge resistors with
        discharge time of 3 min. Alpivar capacitor loss power is 0.3 W
        per 1 kVAr. The capacitor banks we produce are automatic;
        thus, switching on individual capacitor stages is done via
        electromechanical contactors controlled by Alptec power
        factor controller. Cabinets are equipped with compensation
        panels and have the typical and uniform dimensions, which
        simplifies installation and expansion of the cabinets.<br/>
        Our range of capacitor banks is presented in the following
        tables; however, configurations tailored to customer
        requirements are also available
