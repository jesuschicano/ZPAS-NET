        <h2>Switchgears up to 630A</h2>
        Switchgears for currents up to 630 A are made based on our
        own enclosures and enclosures of all the companies on the
        market. Our own structures are based on the basic version
        of the power cabinets manufactured by ZPAS – i.e. SZE2
        cabinets. These cabinets are made of single-walled steel
        sheet and powder coated. Modular equipment is installed
        on dedicated structure. Switchgears based on this design
        are featured with IP 30 safe-to-touch protection degree, and
        IP 64 in case door is closed.<br/>
        These switchgears utilize 60 mm rails from Wohner, hager,
        Eaton, equipment from Abb, Efen, ETI, hager, Eaton,
        Schneider, Schrack, Siemens.
        The switchgears have three distinguished assembly zones:
        <ul>
            <li>busbar system zone (3 bMhs),</li>
            <li>apparatus assembly zone (8 bMhs in case of the cabinets
            2000 mm high),</li>
            <li>cable entry zone (1 bMhs + 100 mm).</li>
        </ul>
        With such a switchgear construction, the cabinets
        2000 mm high and 600 mm wide can contain modular
        instrumentation counting 288 units (18 mm), cabinets 800
        mm wide – 432 modules, and cabinets 1000 mm wide – 576
        modules, respectively.
