        In the period of last few years, the increase of telephoneusers
        and density of ducts surrounding cities which are
        endangered on easy damage, forces the manufacturers
        of telecommunication links to work out and use ducts
        under the earth-surface. Together with the increase of
        transferring wider frequency band, it appeared that there
        are some diffculties with providing appropriate quality of
        transmission with using copper wires. Wider pass bands in
        fast networks, like Gbit Ethernet or ATM, means necessity
        of assistance the copper wires with complicated electronic
        systems. That is the reason why fibre optics became
        alternative solution to copper wires.<br/>

        Not mentioning creation of brand-new networks, one of the
        biggest tasks for telecommunication network is protection
        of already made investments and re-usage of the biggest
        possible part of already existing cable-networks. This
        possibility is given by access systems. Access systems enable
        gradual changing distributive copper wires with fibre optics.
        This solution allows using existing exchange lines not only
        for transmission telephone and ISDN services, but also for
        transmission 2Mb/s flux with using digital exchange line
        technology.<br/>

        The technology of access exchange guarantees updating
        existing transmission network with usage of valuable
        electronic equipment. In order to lower the costs of
        modernisation, the most common solution is joining old
        part of installation (copper wires) with new one (fibre optic
        cables) in outdoor access cabinets (like SZD).
        The main task of outdoor access cabinet is full protection
        of installed equipment. The cabinet fulfils the requirements
        of protection against negative influence of environment
        (rain and snow falls, sun, dust etc) and vandalism. Another
        very important task of SZD cabinets is providing specified
        climatic conditions which depend on installed equipment.
        The construction of SZD cabinet enables optional
        arrangement of inside equipment. It makes possible to
        use SZD cabinets not only in access systems, but also in
        each case where the protection of outdoor equipment
        working in extreme conditions is very important. SZD
        cabinets produced by ZPAS-NET have been already used in
        telecommunication industry, on ships, platforms, stamping
        press and intermediate pumping gas stations, heat and
        power stations, power industry plants, refineries, cement
        plants, for protection of machinery for outdoor lightening
        operating etc.
