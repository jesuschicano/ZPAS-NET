        <h2>Standard roof for SZD</h2>
        Standard roof for SZD cabinets is made of two mantles
        of 1.5 mm thick sheet steel. between the mantles there
        is a gap, which enables to carry away accumulated
        condensation water.
        <h2>Roof in special configuration</h2>
        When it is necessary to cool the cabinet not only
        by ventilating through side shields and doors but also
        additional cooling system, it is possible to use special roof
        made of three mantles of sheet steel. This solution creates
        two air chambers in one of them it is possible to fasten fan
        units which increase the airflow.<br/>
        Applying two-chambers roof causes, that the total height
        of the cabinet is increased by 100 mm.<br/>
        Additionally, it is possible to fix lifting eyes into the roof.
