			<h2>Doors, side shields</h2>
			Doors and side shields of SZD cabinets are made of aluminium rail-profiles which are
			fastened together. The aluminium profiles make double ventilation wall. In the cabinet there
			are mounted two-point rod-latch locks. The door handle is made of zinc and aluminium
			alloy. On customerâ€™s request it is possible to have optional type of patent insert (AbLOY,
			kAbA, EMkA, etc). It is possible to make special opening for temporary cable entry (e. g. from
			outside power supply unit).
