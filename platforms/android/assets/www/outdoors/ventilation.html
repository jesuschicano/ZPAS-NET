        <h2>Ventilation with forced internal and free
        external air circulation</h2>
        Fan units are mounted inside SZD cabinet in order to
        shorten time of carrying away heat dissipation emitted by
        equipment installed in the cabinet. Fan units cause faster air
        movement inside the cabinet and in the
        cabinet’s walls. In case of low temperature the system of
        heaters joint with thermostats is applied. Above solutions
        enable failure-free operation of access systems.

        <h2>Ventilation with forced internal
        and external air circulation</h2>
        In cabinets which are endangered of strong solar radiation,
        it is recommended to use ventilation with double
        air circulation. In this solution, air circulates inside the
        cabinet and additionally flows between the double walls
        of the cabinet. Moreover, circulation of external air is
        forced by fan units mounted in the roof. In case of low
        temperature the system of heaters joint with thermostats
        is applied. Above solutions enable failure-free operation
        of access systems.

        <h2>Ventilation based on use of heat
        exchanger and direct venting</h2>
        In order to intensify the cooling process in cabinets with
        installed equipment with high heat dissipation, there is
        solution based on cross heat exchanger. heat exchanger is
        a type of radiator, where there are two air flows: warm from
        the inside of the cabinet (radiator’s plates collect heat)
        and second from the outside of the cabinet (cooled by
        exchanger). Cross system of the heat exchanger enables to
        retain tightness of the cabinet and external and internal air
        flows do not mix together.<br/>
        Another solution is direct venting of the cabinet, which
        is used when it is necessary to carry away lots of heat
        dissipation. In cabinet’s roof or on the door there are
        mounted fans which pull external air (through double wall
        and filters system). External air goes through appliances
        which emit heat and is carried away outside by roof or
        perforations on the doors.
