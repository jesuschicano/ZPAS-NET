        <h2>CONTROL DESKS DESIGNED FOR INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES</h2>
        Control desks can be made entirely of sheet steel. Console
        shape and dimensions should be tailored to a particular
        facility and appliances in accordance with customers’
        individual needs and requirements.
        <h2>DISPATCH AND DISPATCH/CONTROL DESKS</h2>
        In the case of dispatch or dispatch/control desks which
        also perform a function of an operating workstation, the
        design comprises a base, a desktop, and – if necessary –
        additional tops.<br/>
        Desktops are made of a wide range of materials, from woodlike
        boards to synthetic materials – depending on particular
        needs and standard requested by the customer. In simple
        designs which do not call for an application of expensive
        technologies, double-sided laminated or MDF boards are
        typically used, in a wide range of colours of the finishing
        laminate elements. Acrylic materials, such as Paracor or
        Corian, enable a wider range of applications.<br/>
        Desktops can also be made of mimic panels which allow
        quick and easy changes of visual matrix diagrams and
        arrangements of installed instruments.<br/>
        Desktops can be equipped with tops of various shapes and
        dimensions making it easy to install monitors, push buttons,
        meters, displays or other types of devices.
        <h2>COLOUR SCHEMES</h2>
        Metal elements of consoles can be painted, galvanised
        or made of plain stainless steel, without any extra surface
        finish. We use epoxy and polyester powder paints, textured,
        in all colours from the RAL catalogue.
